      <h1>GIDEON ANDREW MKANGAA</h1>
      <p>Welcome to my portfolio webpage.<br> I designed this webpage using HTML and CSS and drew inspiration for the design from a few webpages I have come across in the past. I had to borrow some of the code without asking but I hope the end result will justfiy the means.<br> Welcome :) </p>

        <h1 id="about">ABOUT ME</h1>
        <p>A little bit of info about myself.</p>

                <h3>How I Got Here</h3>
                <p>Without any intention of becoming a programmer or software developer, I joined Moringa as a means of finding a good and productive way to occupy my idle time. Since joining I have developed somewhat of an interest in the field and am excited to see where the journey takes me. I especially enjoy the google meets sessions and the combination of respectful students and witty, engaging TM's(Shoutout George and Edgar).</p>

            <div class="card">
                <h3>Things I Like</h3>
                <p>In this wonderful life there are a lot of things to like. I personally like when it rains, a lot, especially if the rain is accompanied by bright streaks of lightning and deafning roars of thunder. There's just something about the rain that reminds you of how powerless you are against the great force of mother nature. I like being trapped inside when it rains and having an excuse to wear cozy clothes and throw away the day, a day that would otherwise probably be as hot as the pits of hell itself. I also love music and anything guitar related. Music never lets you down. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Things I Don't Like</h3>
                <p>I don't quite like the feeling of knowing what you want but not knowing how you can get to it. I don't really like the number 1( it's just a little odd). I don't like the feeling of having a sore throat and would put it in a list of the worst things anyone can endure. I don't like consecutive sentences that start the same. I don't like how funny I think this is. I don't like when it doesn't rain.</p>

        <p>Below are clickable links to some of the projects I worked<br> on during my first week of programming with Moringa.<br> Most are incomplete but I did my best haha. </p>

                <a href="https://github.com/GidKang/my-first-webpage.git"><em>My-First-Webpage.html</em></a>
                <p>This was one of the first if not the first HTML projects I worked on. I was still getting familiar with it all and it shows in the brievity and straighforwardnes of the code. Caveman level stuff. However, a good introduction.</p>

            <div class="card2">
                <a href="https://github.com/GidKang/resortproject.git"><em>Resort-Project.html</em></a>
                <p>This project served as a means for me to further practice my HTML skills while also slowly beginning to incorporate basic elements of CSS. The project is incomplete as it stands but it was essentially the foundation upon which this webpage was built.</p>
