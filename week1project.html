      <h1>GIDEON ANDREW MKANGAA</h1>
      <p>Welcome to my portfolio webpage.<br> I designed this webpage using HTML and CSS and drew inspiration for the design from a few webpages I have come across in the past. I had to borrow some of the code without asking but I hope the end result will justfiy the means.<br> Welcome :) </p>

                <h3>How I Got Here</h3>
                <p>Without any intention of becoming a programmer or software developer, I joined Moringa as a means of finding a good and productive way to occupy my idle time. Since joining I have developed somewhat of an interest in the field and am excited to see where the journey takes me. I especially enjoy the google meets sessions and the combination of respectful students and witty, engaging TM's(Shoutout George and Edgar).</p>

                <h3>Things I Like</h3>
                <p>In this wonderful life there are a lot of things to like. I personally like when it rains, a lot, especially if the rain is accompanied by bright streaks of lightning and deafning roars of thunder. There's just something about the rain that reminds you of how powerless you are against the great force of mother nature. I like being trapped inside when it rains and having an excuse to wear cozy clothes and throw away the day, a day that would otherwise probably be as hot as the pits of hell itself. I also love music and anything guitar related. Music never lets you down. </p>

                <h3>Things I Don't Like</h3>
                <p>I don't quite like the feeling of knowing what you want but not knowing how you czan get to it. I don't really like the number 1( it's just a little odd). I don't like the feeling of having a sore throat and would put it in a list of the worst things anyone can endure. I don't like consecutive sentences that start the same. I don't like how funny I think this is. I don't like when it doesn't rain.</p>
